# ukraine-defense-firewall-rules
Live-updating IP blocklists for common firewalls that block IPs reported by [Grey Noise](https://www.greynoise.io/) to be targeting only the Ukrainian IP space. Lists update every 30 minutes.

Hopefully this can be useful to protect infrastructure and organisations in Ukraine from some of the cyberattacks they're victim to next to the physical warfare.
